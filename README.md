### Woo! Hoo! nailed printf()
Another acomplishment at 42. Working on my ft_printf project was one of the most challenging but rewarding experiences in my C learning journey.
At first, it seemed simple, "just recreate printf". 
But once I really got into it, I realized how deep and intricate formatted output actually is.
I had to understand variadic functions, format parsing, type handling, and how each conversion specifier behaves under the hood.

I learned how to manually process characters, strings, integers, hex values, and pointers—all while managing memory carefully and writing clean, modular code.
It also improved my debugging skills because even a tiny mistake could break the entire output.

Even though it took patience and countless test cases, seeing my own ft_printf function work just like the real one felt incredible. 
It taught me how much is happening behind a seemingly simple function call, and it boosted my confidence in writing more complex, low-level logic.

## Project:
### ft_printf()
### Score: 100% - Mandatory Part
This project is a library containing ft_printf(), mimicking the original printf(). ft_printf() is capable of handling the following conversions: 'cspdiuxX%'.

Bonus part? in TBD.
